    "# Task 1:\n",
    "# Please build a simple scraper in Python using the libraries requests and BeautifulSoup. \n",
    "# The scraper should be able to fetch the product title for a given ASIN from the product detail page. \n",
    "# It would be enough if the ASIN can be specified as a variable in the Python script (or Jupyter notebook, whichever you prefer) \n",
    "# and the title is then printed out in the console (or as the cell output in the notebook).\n",
    "# Some tips and notes:\n",
    "# Each product (or product variant, to be more precise) has its own ASIN and a corresponding product detail page. \n",
    "# Each product detail page always has the same kind of URL: www.amazon.de/dp/{ASIN}, e.g. www.amazon.de/dp/B0041G8ZNI.\n",
    "# In the browser, you can look at a page’s source code which you can use to locate elements on the web page \n",
    "# (like, in this case, the title element).\n",
    "# It is very much possible that Amazon doesn’t want you to scrape product detail pages. \n",
    "# In this case, you should look at the concept of “headers” which are extra information you send with your request \n",
    "# that tells the server something about the user, like what OS or browser version you are using \n",
    "# (this particular kind of information is called the “user string”). The server can use this information to predict if you’re a \n",
    "# bot. It is quite easy to add a header to your request in the Python requests library. \n",
